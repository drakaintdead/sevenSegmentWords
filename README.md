# Longest Words on a Seven Segment display

I was looking through youtube and found a video from [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/c/TomScottGo) about the longest word with a seven segment display, and instead of watching it I decided to make my own.  
  
I did this by using [dwyl's english words repository](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) and using a regex to check if a word has characters that aren't allowed.  
*Note that t, i, & o are all technically valid letters, but using them makes some really weird words. (I don't like the look of t, aswell)*
